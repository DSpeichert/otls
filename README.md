(Really Open) Open Tibia LiSt
======
This project is an attempt to create a list of Open Tibia Servers using a Meteor framework.
Unlike other websites listing OTServers, we strive to provide meaningful listing which promotes small, high-quality servers, which don't have many players yet.
We believe that ordering the list by the number of players is devastating and there is no point in promoting the server which report highest number of players.
